## Mental Health Metrics Validation

### ✅ Appropriate Metrics
- Mood level (1-10 scale)
- Energy level
- Sleep quality
- Anxiety level
- Social connection
- Exercise frequency
- Medication adherence

### ⚠️ Requires Careful Framing
- Suicidal ideation (should link to crisis resources)
- Self-harm behaviors (needs immediate support options)
- Substance use (non-judgmental tracking)

### ❌ Not Recommended
- Diagnostic labels (e.g., "Am I bipolar today?")
- Comparative judgments (e.g., "How normal am I?")
- Stigmatizing language

## Clinical Insights Examples

**Good Correlation Finding**:
> "Your data shows that getting 7-8 hours of sleep correlates with improved mood the next day (r=0.75, p<0.01). Consider prioritizing consistent sleep as part of your wellness routine."

**Concerning Pattern**:
> "We notice your mood scores have been consistently low (<3/10) for the past 14 days. While FeelInk helps track patterns, persistent low mood may benefit from professional support. Would you like information on mental health resources?"
